<p>
  This text will wrap around the floated image. When you float an image to the
  left, the surrounding text flows to the right side of the image. This is
  useful for article layouts, blog posts, and product descriptions. You can add
  more and more text to see how it wraps nicely around the image.

<p class="clear">
  This paragraph has clear: both applied, so it will appear below the image
  instead of wrapping around it.
